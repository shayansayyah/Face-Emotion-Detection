# Face-Emotion-Detection

Hello, World.
Humans have always had the innate ability to recognize and distinguish between faces. Now computers are able to do the same. Humans are used to taking in nonverbal cues from facial emotions. Now computers are also getting better to reading emotions.
 Now a days AI and machine learning are becoming so important, useful and even crucial in the whole word because of that, we decided to chose a fresh topic for our final project!
Face Emotion Detection is a new feature which can be use in different fields such as:
Psychology
Criminology 

This project has made with, a GUI, Machine learning Libraries and Python.
First, we designed a simple but useful GUI for the code to make it easier and more comfortable for users.
This GUI was written with Libraries such as:
Tkinter 
And the other use of the GUI is to add my detected emotions file to app.py file.
Second, the main code was writing to do some activities such as:
•	Accessing to the front camera
•	Detecting the face area from the picture object 
•	Predicting a face impression
•	Give a tag to the impression like: angry, happy and …
•	Code declares the closest emoji to the face impression 
•	And at least it will be shown to the user as the final result
It is noticeable that all these steps will be done using Machine learning Libraries specifically:
FER, cv2 
And more Libraries such as:
NumPy, sys, imutils.video, operator ,  PIL , emoji 
Showing the result as an emoji was a solution for was to make the code more user friendly and a bit fun.
And fortunately, it worked perfectly and in our point of view, a result with a cute emoji which show the same emotion and impression as the face of users is more recallable than just a cold text.

The project is included from 2 main part:

(app.py)

Fer library is a short form for the Face Emotion recognition and it is a very interesting, powerful, and complex library to work with this library can train the model based on it self with the best possible accuracy and the closest result.
This library made the project easier for us and it works like a very heavy dataset that should be import and train but Fer did it by itself.
Using Fer was the bast option for us in compression of writing lines of codes to train, test a model and importing a large dataset.
For use and testing the code please first:
Run app.py 
The app will be pop up on your screen
Press the bottom for start
the web cam will be open and you can see the result!
for the exit you can press the Q.
Thanks for you attention and we hope you enjoy the program.
